README

Blog app which is meant to be used in other django aplications. Implemented considering DRY principle.

Why this project exists?

The current purpose of this project is learning. I wish to learn web
development in pyhton. And this is my practise project. But that does 
not mean this project won't be below the standards. Currently it is a learning project but it will grow into a production ready application.

Future Plans

1. App which can be plugged in into existing applications.
2. Multiple contributors to the sam eblog.
3. Create a system in which multiple users can contribute to create 
	posts.


Feel free to fork the project, create bug reports and all the good stuff.
